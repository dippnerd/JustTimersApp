        <h3>About Just Timers</h3>
        <p>Just Timers is the missing timers app for iOS. Create multiple timers that can run simultaneously, create complex timer routines using intervals and templates, sync timers across devices so you never miss one. Use Critical Alerts to override your device's mute settings, select from a variety of alert tones and options like Stop Playback.</p>

        <p>Keep it simple, or use power user features such as Shortcuts to create complex routines dynamically with complete control from any device. Use "Run Action" to run a Shortcut or URL when the timer ends. </p>

        <p>The app is free to download, which allows you to create up to two timers at a time. To unlock <b>Tier 1</b> which includes: <b>unlimited timers</b>, <b>iCloud Sync</b> and <b>Widgets</b>, there is a small upgrade of <b>$1.99</b>. 

        <p>To unlock more advanced features (including all of Tier 1), Tier 2 includes <b>Quick Timers</b>, <b>Interval Timers</b>, <b>Templates</b>, <b>Run Actions</b>, <b>More Alert Sounds</b> and <b>Critical Alerts</b> for only <b>$4.99</b>, a 40% savings.

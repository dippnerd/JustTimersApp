        <h4 id="more-than-one">Can I create more than one active timer?</h4>
        <p>Yes! In fact, you can create as many timers as you would like! There is a limit of 2 timers on the free tier, but unlocking “unlimited timers” gives you exactly what it sounds like:  unlimited timers.</p>

        <h4 id="name-timers">Are there any hidden costs?</h4>
        <p>The app is free to use up to 2 timers at a time, but to use more you will need to unlock "unlimited timers" for a small fee. Beyond that, there are no other fees related to additional features.</p>

        <h4 id="name-timers">Can I name timers?</h4>
        <p>Yes! By default the new timer dialog will populate with a default suggested name, but you’re free to change that as you see fit.</p>

        <h4 id="max-time">How long can a timer be?</h4>
        <p>Currently the max duration a timer can be set for is 23 hours, 59 minutes and 59 seconds. This will likely be extended in the future depending on demand.</p>

        <h4 id="edit-timer">Can I edit an existing timer?</h4>
        <p>Yes, you can change the starting duration of the timer, but not the name. Name changing may be added later depending on demand.</p>

        <h4 id="voice-timers">How do Siri Shortcuts/voice timers work?</h4>
        <p>To use your voice to control timers, you must first assign Siri Shortcuts to your timers. You can assign them to individual timers either at creation time or by tapping the timer to bring up the edit view.</p>

        <p>To add Shortcuts at creation, simply provide a unique name and duration for your timer, then tap "Add Shortcuts" to expand the menu for available shortcuts. Editting an existing timer will present this shortcut menu for you automatically. For individual timers these include "Start", "Pause" and "Resume". "Start" will restart your timer to its initial value and make it active. You can assign this phrase as something like "start tea" or "start tea timer" to have specific tasks, for example. You can also create more generic timer names like "20 minute" with a duration of 20 minutes, then assign a Shortcut phrase for "start 20 minute timer".</p>

        <p>To assign Shortcuts to broader actions like "pause all timers", go to the Settings page in the upper left corner and under the "Siri Shortcuts" menu you will find the generic Shortcuts</p>

        <p>Because of the how Siri handles these Shortcuts, they do need to be assigned, rather than being automatically created for you. The key is that you must assign trigger phrases to them for Siri to recognize it</p>

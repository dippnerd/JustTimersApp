        <h4 id="more-than-one">Can I create more than one active timer?</h4>
        <p>Yes! In fact, you can create as many timers as you would like! There is a limit of 2 timers on the free tier, but unlocking “unlimited timers” gives you exactly what it sounds like:  unlimited timers.</p>

        <h4 id="name-timers">Are there any hidden costs?</h4>
        <p>The app is free to use up to 2 timers at a time, but to use more you will need to unlock "unlimited timers" for a small fee. Beyond that, there are no other fees related to additional features.</p>

        <h4 id="name-timers">Can I name timers?</h4>
        <p>Yes! By default the new timer dialog will populate with a default suggested name, but you’re free to change that as you see fit.</p>

        <h4 id="max-time">How long can a timer be?</h4>
        <p>Currently the max duration a timer can be set for is 23 hours, 59 minutes and 59 seconds. This will likely be extended in the future depending on demand.</p>

        <h4 id="edit-timer">Can I edit an existing timer?</h4>
        <p>Yes, you can change the starting duration of the timer, but not the name. Name changing may be added later depending on demand.</p>

        <h4 id="voice-timers">How do voice timers work?</h4>
        <p>There are a few ways to use voice with this app. The recommended method is using Siri Shortcuts, where you first create a timer, then go to the stock iOS Settings app, locate "Siri & Search" and the menu "All Shortcuts", then look for "Just Timers" and tap on the shortcut you wish to create. Here you can assign a phrase to restart timers such as "tea time" to restart an existing tea timer you created. </p>

        <p>Another way to use voice is the Shortcuts app found on the App Store. We have a downloadable shortcut that lets you assign a Siri trigger phrase to it, then you can dictate a name and duration for creating or modifying timers. </p>
    
        <p>Thirdly, we have a built in function that can be enabled in the app settings, under the “Voice” menu, that will provide a native way to dictate timers. This is still an experimental feature and may not work reliably. It will allow you to create timers using your voice, and will ask for the name and duration as it fills each one in. </p>

        <h4 id="refund">How can I get a refund?</h4>
        <p>If you are dissatisfied with this app, please let us know first to see if we can help! If you're sure you want a refund, <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204084">here</a> are instructions for requesting a refund directly from Apple.</p>

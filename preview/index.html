        <h4 id="rebuilt">Completely rebuilt from the ground up</h4>
        <p>Just Timers v2 is a complete rebuild from scratch. It can import your previous timers, though some Shortcuts may need updated. Rebuilding the app gives it a fresh start to let go of any legacy bugs or limitations. </p>

        <h4 id="new-types">New Timer Types</h4>
        <p>Not only does Just Timers v2 have count down timers, but now it also supports stopwatch/count up timers as well as interval timers. They are all customizable in a variety of ways like group, color and icon, as well as expanded support for Shortcuts.</p>



        <h4 id="groups-filters">Sorting, Groups and Filters</h4>
        <p>Now you can easily organize your timers into groups, or use filters to see only see active timers or all timers at once. Sort a given view by name, active timer or even customize their sorting. In the future I plan to include custom filters as well.</p>

        <h4 id="icloud-sync">iCloud Sync</h4>
        <p>Use iCloud sync to keep your timers in sync across devices. No matter where you're at you can see your favorite timers and their progress!</p>

        <h4 id="alert-options">Alert Options</h4>
        <p>Just Timers v1 was very limited when it came to options for alert sounds, but now there is a variety of sounds to pick from as well as tweaks to whether to repeat notifications, or even override the mute switch and other silencing methods.</p>

        <h4 id="self-destruct">Self-Destruct Timers</h4>
        <p>Don't want your timer to persist after it finishes? Just enable Self-Destruct and the timer will destroy itself upon completion.</p>

		<h4 id="icons-colors">Icons and Colors</h4>
        <p>Stylize your groups and timers with a variety of icons and colors to set them apart.</p>

        <h4 id="shortcuts">Shortcuts & Siri</h4>
        <p>Shortcuts support has been expanded with the additions available in iOS 14. Create and delete timers, tweak their settings, show specific or active timers and groups/filters.</p>

        <p>As if that weren't already enough, Just Timers also includes support to add your own Shortcuts or other URLs to run when a timer completes!</p>

		<h4 id="watch-app">New Watch App</h4>
        <p>Thanks to the improvements with watchOS 7, the watch app has also been completely rewritten. It can even sync with iCloud so your timers stay up to date even if you're not near your phone. (Requires wifi or LTE to sync away from phone)</p>

        <h4 id="mac-app">Mac App</h4>
        <p>To complete the set of supported devices, a Mac app will be coming as well that can keep your timers in sync. </p>

        <h4 id="widgets">Widgets</h4>
        <p>The latest widgets support will be coming too! Quickly view progress or even tap to jump into a timer quickly.</p>
